Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained using a dataset of credit card transactions, with the goal of identifying whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

Project Overview
The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions, and it is highly imbalanced, with a much larger number of legitimate transactions compared to fraudulent ones. The objective of this project is to detect fraud through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset and handle missing values.
Data Analysis: Explore the distribution of transactions, both legitimate and fraudulent.
Handling Imbalance: Implement under-sampling to balance the dataset.
Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy on training and test datasets.
Installation
To run this project, make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You'll also need the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Download the dataset from Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset.
Unzip the dataset and place the creditcard.csv file in the root directory of this project.
Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook (credit card.ipynb) to train the model and view the results.
Code Walkthrough
Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

python
Copy
credit_card_data = pd.read_csv('/content/creditcard.csv.zip')
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

View the first few rows of the dataset.
Check for missing values and assess the distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Handling Imbalance:

Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, we create a balanced dataset by under-sampling the legitimate transactions.
Splitting the Data: The dataset is split into features (X) and target (Y) variables. The data is further divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Training: We train a Logistic Regression model using the training data.

python
Copy
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated using accuracy scores on both training and testing data.

python
Copy
training_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_train_prediction, Y_train)
test_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_test_prediction, Y_test)
Results
The model's accuracy is measured on both the training and testing datasets. The accuracy scores will help assess how well the model performs in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Example Output:
bash
Copy
Accuracy on Training data: 0.935
Accuracy on Test Data: 0.92
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to implement a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By handling the data imbalance and training a logistic regression model, we can predict fraudulent transactions with reasonable accuracy.
